# Feature Specification: Code Review and Project Restructuring

**Feature Branch**: `001-code-review-restructure`
**Created**: 2025-09-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "hacer un code review de todo el repo. reorganizacion de la estructura del proyecto y limpieza completa de los archivos, eliminar viejos unificar cosas duplicadas"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Identified: code review, restructuring, cleanup, remove old files, unify duplicates
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: developers, maintainers
   ‚Üí Actions: review, reorganize, clean, eliminate, unify
   ‚Üí Data: existing codebase, project structure
   ‚Üí Constraints: maintain functionality, follow constitution principles
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí No major clarifications needed - scope is comprehensive review
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Developer workflow improvements identified
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement is testable and measurable
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Project files, directories, configurations
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí All sections complete
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT needs improvement and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no specific refactoring patterns yet)
- üë• Written for development team and stakeholders

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer on the ColeApp project, I need a clean, well-organized codebase with clear structure, no duplicate code, and no obsolete files, so that I can efficiently develop new features and maintain existing functionality.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the current repository state, **When** code review is complete, **Then** all code follows constitution principles (Security-First, Multitenant Isolation, TDD, Mobile-First, Configuration Over Code)
2. **Given** duplicate code exists, **When** unification is complete, **Then** no duplicate functionality remains and code is DRY
3. **Given** obsolete files exist, **When** cleanup is complete, **Then** only active, necessary files remain
4. **Given** current project structure, **When** reorganization is complete, **Then** structure follows best practices for the tech stack

### Edge Cases
- What happens when removing a file breaks dependencies? ‚Üí Update all imports and references
- How does system handle shared code between modules? ‚Üí Create proper shared libraries
- What about configuration files that may seem duplicate? ‚Üí Consolidate where safe, document where necessary

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST undergo comprehensive code review covering all modules (mobile-app, backend, web-admin, infrastructure)
- **FR-002**: System MUST identify and document all code quality issues, security concerns, and constitution violations
- **FR-003**: Project MUST be restructured to follow NestJS, Next.js, and React Native best practices
- **FR-004**: System MUST eliminate all duplicate code through proper abstraction and shared libraries
- **FR-005**: Project MUST remove all obsolete, unused, and deprecated files
- **FR-006**: Configuration files MUST be consolidated and organized consistently
- **FR-007**: Dependencies MUST be audited and unnecessary ones removed
- **FR-008**: Documentation MUST be updated to reflect new structure
- **FR-009**: All changes MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality
- **FR-010**: Test coverage MUST be maintained or improved (backend ‚â•80%, frontend ‚â•70%)

### Key Entities
- **Project Modules**: mobile-app, backend, web-admin, infrastructure directories
- **Configuration Files**: package.json, tsconfig.json, .env files, Docker configurations
- **Shared Code**: Common utilities, types, constants that can be unified
- **Test Suites**: Unit tests, integration tests, e2e tests that need updating
- **Documentation**: README files, API docs, architecture documents
