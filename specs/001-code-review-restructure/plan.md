## Summary
Comprehensive code review and restructuring of the ColeApp repository to improve code quality, eliminate duplicates, remove obsolete files, and reorganize the project structure following best practices for NestJS, Next.js, and React Native while maintaining strict adherence to constitutional principles.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x / Node.js 20+
**Primary Dependencies**: NestJS, Next.js 14, React Native/Expo, PostgreSQL, Redis
**Storage**: PostgreSQL (multitenant), Redis (cache), Google Cloud Storage (files)
**Testing**: Jest for all modules, Cypress for e2e
**Target Platform**: Web (admin), iOS/Android (mobile), Cloud Run (backend)
**Project Type**: Full-stack multi-module (web + mobile + backend)
**Performance Goals**: Backend <200ms p95, Mobile 60fps, Web LCP <2.5s
**Constraints**: Maintain backward compatibility, zero downtime refactoring
**Scale/Scope**: 3 main modules, ~50k LOC total, 100+ components

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [x] **Security-First Architecture**: Review will enforce security practices, remove exposed secrets
- [x] **Multitenant Isolation**: Ensure tenant boundaries are properly maintained in refactoring
- [x] **Test-Driven Development**: Maintain/improve test coverage during restructuring
- [x] **Mobile-First UX**: Preserve mobile optimization in any shared code extraction
- [x] **Configuration Over Code**: Remove any hard-coded values, improve configuration management

**Structure Decision**: Maintain existing multi-module structure with improvements for shared code

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context**:
   - Current code duplication patterns across modules
   - Obsolete files and deprecated dependencies
   - Security vulnerabilities in current code
   - Test coverage gaps
   - Performance bottlenecks

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   Task: "Analyze code duplication across mobile-app, backend, web-admin"
   Task: "Identify obsolete files and unused dependencies"
   Task: "Review security practices and find vulnerabilities"
   Task: "Analyze test coverage and identify gaps"
   Task: "Find performance issues and optimization opportunities"
   Task: "Review project structure against NestJS/Next.js/RN best practices"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: What issues were found
   - Rationale: Why they need fixing
   - Alternatives considered: Different approaches to restructuring

**Output**: research.md with complete codebase analysis

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from analysis** → `data-model.md`:
   - Module boundaries and dependencies
   - Shared code opportunities
   - File organization patterns
   - Configuration consolidation points

2. **Generate quality contracts** → `/contracts/`:
   - Code style guidelines
   - Module boundary rules
   - Dependency management policies
   - Test coverage requirements
   - Security standards

3. **Generate validation tests**:
   - Linting rules compliance
   - Test coverage thresholds
   - Security scan passes
   - No circular dependencies
   - No duplicate code above threshold

4. **Extract validation scenarios** → `quickstart.md`:
   - How to verify restructuring success
   - Performance benchmarks to maintain
   - Functionality smoke tests

5. **Update CLAUDE.md** incrementally:
   - Add restructuring context
   - Document new patterns adopted
   - Update with clean architecture decisions

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, validation tests, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Analyze research.md findings for specific issues
- Group related cleanup tasks by module
- Create removal tasks for obsolete files [P]
- Create unification tasks for duplicate code
- Create restructuring tasks for poor organization
- Create validation tasks for each change

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Remove obsolete files first (safe, no dependencies)
- Extract shared code second (creates new dependencies)
- Restructure modules third (uses shared code)
- Update configurations fourth (reflects new structure)
- Run validations last (confirms success)

**Estimated Output**: 40-50 tasks covering all modules

**Categories**:
- Cleanup: Remove obsolete files, unused deps [P]
- Unification: Extract duplicate code to shared libs
- Restructuring: Reorganize files by best practices
- Configuration: Consolidate and organize configs
- Documentation: Update to reflect changes
- Validation: Run tests, linting, security scans

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution via /tasks command
**Phase 4**: Implementation following task list
**Phase 5**: Validation and performance verification

## Complexity Tracking
*No violations - this is a maintenance/improvement task that reduces complexity*

N/A - All changes align with constitution principles and reduce technical debt.

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [x] Complexity deviations documented (none needed)
